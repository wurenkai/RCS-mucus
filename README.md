***Note: Due to the preciousness of the dataset, as with the previous [fundus dataset](https://github.com/wurenkai/UWF-RHS-Dataset-and-MASNet) and [oral dataset](https://github.com/wurenkai/HF-UNet-and-Autooral-dataset), we will fully publish our dataset and code upon acceptance of the article. Our paper is in the review stage. Please stay tuned for updates on our progress.***
